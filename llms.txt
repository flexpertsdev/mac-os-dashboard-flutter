## Development Workflow

### Getting Started
```bash
# Install dependencies
flutter pub get

# Run on different platforms
flutter run                    # Default platform
flutter run -d chrome         # Web browser
flutter run -d ios           # iOS simulator
flutter run -d android       # Android emulator

# Build for production
flutter build web            # Web deployment
flutter build apk           # Android APK
flutter build ios           # iOS app
```

### State Management Pattern
The app uses Provider for state management with service-based architecture:
- `NavigationService`: Handles app navigation state
- `DashboardService`: Manages dashboard data and analytics
- `UsersService`: User data and preferences management

### Responsive Design
- Utilizes `responsive_helper.dart` for breakpoint management
- Adaptive navigation components (sidebar vs bottom navigation)
- Flexible grid layouts that adapt to screen size

## Data Visualization
- Interactive charts powered by fl_chart library
- Customizable metric cards for KPI display
- Analytics grid system for flexible dashboard layouts
- Real-time data updates through Provider state management

## Platform Considerations

### Web Deployment
- PWA manifest configured for web app installation
- Service worker support for offline functionality
- Responsive breakpoints for desktop/tablet/mobile

### Mobile Optimization
- Bottom navigation for mobile-first experience
- Touch-friendly UI components
- Optimized performance for mobile devices

### Desktop Experience
- Sidebar navigation for larger screens
- Enhanced data visualization capabilities
- Keyboard navigation support

## Performance Features
- Lazy loading of dashboard components
- Efficient state management with Provider
- Optimized chart rendering with fl_chart
- Local storage for improved app performance

## Security & Data
- Local data persistence with shared_preferences
- Secure storage patterns for sensitive information
